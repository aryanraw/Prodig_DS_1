# Prodigy Data Science Internship Task 1

## Task Description
"Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population."

## Dataset
The datasets used for this task are CSV files containing population data, including information on the total population and the population below 14 years of age, for various countries.

## Code Overview
The provided code performs the following tasks:
- Loads the population data from CSV files.
- Cleans the data by dropping unnecessary columns.
- Filters the data to select the population data for a chosen country (in this case, India).
- Visualizes the total population trend over the years using a bar chart and histogram.
- Visualizes the population below 14 years of age over the years using a bar chart and histogram.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the repository and instructions for usage.
- `population_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for analyzing the population data.
- `world total (population).csv`: CSV file containing the total population data.
- `below 14 (total population).csv`: CSV file containing the population below 14 years of age data.

## Usage
To use the code:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (listed below).
3. Run the `population_analysis.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
